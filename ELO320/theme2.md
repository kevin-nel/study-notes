## SE method In Depth
for each phase the entire sys eng mehtod is repeated (requirements analysis. functional definition, physical defniitions, design validation)

### Needs Analysis

1. Requirements/Operationa Analysis
    - purpose of system
    - what it should do
1. Functional Requirements
    - what it should do
1. Performance requirements
    - How should it be done
1. Feasibility Definition
    - can it be done
1. Physical Requirements
    - size, weight, appearance, etc.
1. Needs Validation
    - Do the functions flfill the needs
    - MOP (Measure of Performance)

### Concept Exploration

1. Operational/Requirements Analysis
    - Elicited Requierments
    - Requirements analysis
    - Validation
    - Document
    - 6 questions
          *WHY* and *WHAT* -> operational and functional performance requirements
          *WHO* and *HOW* -> operational concepts
          *WHERE* and *WHEN* -> Operations context
1. Performance Requirements Formulation
    - turns fuzzy into engineering
    - define subsystems
    - functional exploration
        - inputs -> transformative functions -> outputs
1. Implementation Concept Exploration
    -  are different physical ways of implementing the functions?
1. Performance Requirement Validation
    - Performance characteristic integration
        - which concepts adress the operational requirements
        - remove redundancies
    - Performance characteristic Validation
        - do the characteristics that remain meet operational requirements

### Concept Definition

(done for each concept)

1. Requirements Analysis 
    - check if reuirements are feasable
    - consider new types of requirements
    - consider full life cycle
1. Functional Analysis
    - refinements
    - functional block diagram
